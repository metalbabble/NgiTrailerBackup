#About
This is a small, sample application which uses GM NGI vehicle data to estimate the direction of a trailer backing up. The app will show an image of the direction of the trailer based on steering wheel angle.

THIS APP IS FOR DEMO USE ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED IN AN ACTUAL VEHICLE.

#Getting Started
